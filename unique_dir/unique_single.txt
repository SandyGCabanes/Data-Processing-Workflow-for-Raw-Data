Unemployed as of the moment
Anywhere, as I'm not really being required to go onsite, but I do choose to go onsite during the latter half of my shifts because I wait for my partner to finish her shift - she works also in the same company, but her shift finishes 3hours after mine ends.
Not Working
Hybrid - first half at home, then usually go to the office for the latter half until I finish the rest of my shift.
Field work or area

Hybrid - Priority at Home, but would come to site if needed
